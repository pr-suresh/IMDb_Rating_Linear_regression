Project Proposal for Linear Regression using IMDB movie Ratings

Our client for the IMDB movie ratings project is a movie production company
in Hollywood. The goal of the project is to look at movie ratings from the IMDB
website and help the production company decide which type of movie can they make
next in order for it to be profitable.

In order to accomplish the goal of the project, I will be using data from the IMDB
website by scraping the site. An individual row for analysis would contain the columns:
IMDB Title ID, title_type, genre, runtime, mpaa_rating, studio, release year,
release month, theater release day, DVD release year, director, actors etc.
Target is the IMDB score value.

Tools used:
BeautifulSoup
Pandas, Numpy
Matplotlib and Seaborn
Scikit learn

MVP
I will be trying to establish a link between the main feature that impacts the
IMDB movie score the most and plot it as a graph.
